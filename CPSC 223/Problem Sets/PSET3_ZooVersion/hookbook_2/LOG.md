# Actual time to complete assignment
|     Date     | Time Started |     Time Spent |     Work completed|
| 3/5/23       |       2:00PM |         4 hours|    Read spec, loaded in files, began playing around with building a solution
| 3/7/23       |       9:00AM |         3 hours |  Worked on hookbook Part 1,
worked on being able to successfully read in file input and defining the structs correctly
| 3/8/23       |      6:00PM |          3 hours | Worked on hookbook Part 1, mainly tried different methods to read in strings and make pirates with those strings
| 3/10/23      |      12:00PM |         4 hours | Worked on hookbook Part 1, pretty much finished it, got expansion to work, still having issues with long continuous strings that are more than 64 characters. Moving on to Part 2 and will address later.
| 3/11/23      |      10:00AM |         8 hours | Worked on part 2, mainly focused on reading input from both files, populating struct fields, and getting the memory to "line up" (pointers matching, not passing in mismatched datatypes, etc.)
| 3/12/23      |    9:30AM    |         9 hours | Worked on part 2, mainly focused on sorting the profiles, correctly printing with the variations based on captain status, and starting to go through the anomalies in the README to make sure that my program could handle them. Having trouble with the asterisks and printing the correct number of them, but getting there. Decided to make a separate hookbook library because some processes were more easily done with helper functions.
| 3/13/23      |    10:00AM   |         10 hours | Worked on part 2, working through the edge cases and problem specification to make sure my program can handle a large variety of input. Made some changes to my sorting functions to make sure that it created output that was the same as the testing script and the autograder. Still running into some issues with the asterisks. I thought I had a solution, but it wasn't quite right. Will keep trying. Added some more functions to the library to help with my program. I'm writing this at the end of the day and I can proudly say that my program passes all the tests, handles all the possible anomalies (to my knowledge, at least), but has one remaining issue of handling the correct number of asterisks. I'll give it one more day to figure that one out. Nearly there but a lot of progress made.
| 3/14/23     |   11:00AM    |         4 hours | Finally got the asterisks to print correctly! I put the finishing touches on that solution and then did some final tests on my program. I tested it with different file content, empty files, no files, empty profile files, empty pirate-captain pair files, and played around with the code to make sure it met the specification. I also went through the style guide to make sure my code met the style requirements and also went through and added more comments to make things easier to understand. I also made sure to double check memory to make sure I closed every file and freed up any memory that I had allocated previously. Very happy to be done!

# Collaboration
I did not discuss my solution with anyone else in the class. 

# Discussion
Let me say this problem set was a CHALLENGE!! However, it was one that I actually enjoyed. Yes, it was quite frustrating at time and did require the use of 4 late days (2 under the revised policy for this problem set, thank goodness), but it was very satisfying to see it work in the end. It took hundreds of lines and tons of trial and error, but it worked out in the end. Some particular difficulties at first had to do with constructing the struct correctly so other helper functions and modifying the struct actually worked without causing segmentation faults and other miscellaneous errors. After getting that to work, the next major challenge was getting the input in the file to be correctly processed and put into the struct. One of the smaller challenges, for example, was getting the captain information of a different pirate from the one the program was indexed at. Once I got the information to populate correctly, I had to sort the structs based on different criteria. I wanted to abstract that process away, but I wasn't able to figure out how to get the captain/pirates pairs to be compatible with the function, so I wasn't able to implement that and even though stylistically it is not ideal, it's better that it works. Printing the profiles out was also a challenge because the format had to follow a specific format that depended on the actual content within each profile. One particularly difficult challenge was figuring out how to keep track of the number of times a skill appeared and use that to keep track of the number of asterisks that needed to be printed. I tried many different things and much to my chagrin, none of them worked. On the last day of working on the assignment, I finally arrived at a solution that worked. Instead of adding asterisks later after sorting, I tried concatenating the correct number of asterisks to the skill strings and then sorting and removing duplicates. That ended up working with various ways of listing skills in the profiles file, so it was a huge relief to get that to work. Overall, however, this problem set was very stimulating and I can say that I learned a lot and am quite comfortable with a lot of different techniques, functions, and skills within C. My goodness, it did take a lot of time, and honestly my log hours are probably on the more conservative side of estimates, but I think in the grand scheme of things it was worth it.
