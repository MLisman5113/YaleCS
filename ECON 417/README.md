# ECON 417: Computational Methods in Economics

**Course Description:** Many of the models used in modern quantitative research in economics do not have analytical (or closed-form) solutions. For this reason, the computer has become an indispensable tool for conducting research in economics. The purpose of this course is twofold: first, to introduce students to numerical methods for analyzing economic models; second, to illustrate how economists use these methods in all subfields of economics, including macroeconomics, finance, labor economics, industrial organization, public finance, and environmental economics, with a special emphasis on solving and simulating dynamic economic models, that is, models in which time plays a central role.

The first part of the course teaches a variety of computational tools for tackling classic problems in numerical analysis: root-finding, minimization, interpolation and approximation of functions, and numerical integration. The course then teaches how these tools can be used to approximate the solutions to dynamic programming problems, with applications drawn from many parts of economics. Finally, the course teaches how to compute economic equilibria in dynamic settings in which actors (firms, households, workers) solve dynamic programs.

A parallel objective of the course is to teach students how to use Julia, a modern programming language for scientific computing. Upon successful completion of the course, students should be confident users both of Julia and of numerical methods in economics.

This course is designed for advanced undergraduate students who have taken intermediate microeconomics, intermediate macroeconomics, econometrics, and calculus and for graduate students who have taken first-year graduate courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. No knowledge of either numerical methods or computer programming is assumed, though some experience with programming would prove helpful.
