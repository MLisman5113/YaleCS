
# Q1(a)
# a1(a0) = (β*(1+r)*(a0+y0)-y1) / (1+β)(1+r)

# Q1(b)
# Compute c0 and c1 by plugging in the expression of a1(a0)
# Then compute lifetime utility as a function of a0

# Q1(c)
# Use some simple example (e.g. y=x^2) to test your Newton algorithm
# First plot the graph of the function to eyeball the root

# Q2(c)
# For lifetime utility, don't directly compute the analytical solution
# Instead, first compute c0, c1(yH), c1(yL) as function of a1, then plug in lifetime utility

# Q3

# Goal is to find two prices such that 
# the excess demand for two goods are 0 at the same time
